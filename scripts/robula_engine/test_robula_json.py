        "Encompassing modern day Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, the African region known as the western Sahel lies just south of the Saharan Desert, and it was there that a succession of mighty empires rose and fell between the Second and 19th centuries. Made wealthy and powerful by a network of trade routes that ran through the area, these dominions developed a rich visual culture which is now being given a showcase in this selection of 200 objects that includes sculptures in wood, stone, fired clay, and bronze; objects in gold and cast metal; woven and dyed textiles; and illuminated manuscripts.",
        "By the late 1950s Abstract Expressionism had run its course, while its core tenetthat painting through gestural brushwork constituted a kind of existential theater with the artist as starhad hardened into orthodoxy. Representational styles like Pop Art emerged in reaction, but there remained a group of painters committed to abstraction who looked for a fresh approach. They found it through an emphasis on color achieved by soaking thinned pigments into the canvas instead of slathering it on the surface. Variously called Lyrical Expressionism or Color Field painting, the style was championed by New York art critic Clement Greenberg (whose previous writings on Pollock, De Kooning, et al. were instrumental in boosting AbEx) though its impact was largely confined the early 1960s. This exhibition revisits that period with works by key figures of the time such as and Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski."

        "Though many members of our team were somewhat hesitant to take an art class in the beginning, by the end of our time at the Art Studio NY, we had all fallen in love with the experience and as a result, our team is still raving about it! It truly felt as though Rebecca and her amazing staff knew exactly how to make our time both unique as well as a fun learning experience, where we not only bonded as a team, but got the opportunity to create beautiful art while doing so!",
        "This the second team building event we have had with The Art Studio NY at our hedge fund. Our core executive staff consists of 40 people, and most of us dont know how to paint or draw! Rebecca, Michelle and all of the instructors brought out the artist in all of us. They went above and beyond to understand our goals and create an outstanding experience. Their attention to detail in planning our event combined with their step by step art instruction impressed my entire team. Our paintings are hanging in our offices and we are all still talking about hoe memorable this experience was for us."
