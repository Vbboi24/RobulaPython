<p dir="ltr">The Seattle Erotic Art Festival is an experience unlike any other festival or gallery you have likely ever attended. &#160;Over the course of three days, a curated selection of some of the finest erotic art the world has to offer will grace the floors of the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, awaiting your perusal and enjoyment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During regular festival hours, you are invited to view the art and daily entertainments, from poetry readings to dance to acrobatic displays. &#160;There is also the&#160;Festival Store, where you can often find prints by the artists featured in the festival as well as other unique items and annual Seattle Erotic Art Festival merchandise.&#160;In the evenings, the vibe changes from a gallery to sexy art party. The Late Night Festival is a sexy, fun time with performers, bartenders at the ready, and a fantastically energetic crowd.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Festival art will engage you, titillate you, and make you think. &#160;Not every piece is to everyone&#226;&#128;&#153;s tastes, but there is something there that will speak to you &#226;&#128;&#147; and what doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t can lead to some fascinating conversations. Whether you are joining us for the first time and new to the sex positive community, or have attended these events for years &#226;&#128;&#147; this festival is for<em>&#160;you</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More information about artists and schedules will be available at <a href="https://www.seattleerotic.org/">SeattleErotic.org</a> and will updated regularly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before 6pm, the Festival is open to those 18 and older. After 6pm, the event becomes 21+.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASL Interpretation will be available on Saturday, April 25, 2020. Please contact director@seattleerotic.org with questions or timing requests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Featured art is by A. O. Hamer.</p>
