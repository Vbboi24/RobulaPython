Each year, AFH&#226;&#128;&#153;s Youth Arts Enterprise employs hundreds of Boston teens in the visual arts and creative industries, bringing diverse young people from communities across the city together as a community of artists. Training and employing urban teens offers them a key solution to economic disenfranchisement, and has a powerful positive impact on their lives, their families, and their communities.</p>
