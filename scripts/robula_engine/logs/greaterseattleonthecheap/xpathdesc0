<p>Our event calendar features fun, free, and cheap things to do around the Puget Sound region. In the weekend event list below for <b>July 17-19, 2020</b>, you&#226;&#128;&#153;ll find virtual as well as live events.</p>
<p>Based on prevailing COVID-19 guidance in Washington State, as stay-at-home orders are lifted, we include outdoor things to do and any other permissible activities during the phased re-opening of counties across the state as the region restarts the economy.&#160;</p>
<p>We&#226;&#128;&#153;ll continue to take our cues from Washington State government and the phased re-opening of our economy into summer. We offer more information from government agencies about staying healthy <a href="https://www.greaterseattleonthecheap.com/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. For more specific information, read <a href="https://www.greaterseattleonthecheap.com/stores-closing-coronavirus/">what&#226;&#128;&#153;s open/closed: stay-at-home order</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For weekdays or any other weekend during the year be sure to visit the <a href="https://www.greaterseattleonthecheap.com/events/">Greater Seattle on the Cheap event calendar</a>. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s your one stop place any time you&#226;&#128;&#153;re want to find something fun to do without shelling out a lot of moola.</p>
<p>Greater Seattle on the Cheap publishes information about free and cheap events, discount tickets on entertainment, and tips for saving money while living in (or visiting) the Puget Sound region. We cover the Seattle-Tacoma Metro area and surrounding region, from Mt. Vernon to JBLM, Bremerton to North Bend, and everywhere in-between.</p>
<p>We focus on free events, cheap things to do ($15 admission, or less), discount tickets on entertainment through Goldstar, and other ways to reduce entertainment costs (such as buy tickets in advance, use a coupon or code, or volunteer at the event).</p>
<p>You&#226;&#128;&#153;ll find things to do this weekend, plus plenty of choices every night of the week, including movies, live music, fairs &amp; festivals, sporting events, and more&#226;&#128;&#147;anything we find that our readers might enjoy.</p>
<p>We post the deals as we find them. But you know the drill: Prices and promotions are subject to change without notice. So be sure to check with the merchant before you head out.</p>
