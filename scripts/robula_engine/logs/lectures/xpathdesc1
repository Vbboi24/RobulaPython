<p>For 32 years, Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures has brought people together for the most important conversations of our time. In this uncertain time, what <em>is</em> certain is that we need writers and readers more than ever. And so, we are asking you to subscribe today to a new year of imagination and re-imagination. All subscriptions are now on sale, as well as single tickets for special events!</p>

<p>David Mitchell is the award-winning, best-selling author of&#160;<em>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</em>,&#160;<em>Black Swan Green</em>,&#160;<em>Cloud Atlas</em>,&#160;<em>Number9Dream</em>,&#160;<em>Ghostwritten,</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>The Bone Clocks</em>. His new book,&#160;<em>Utopia Avenue</em>, is a story of a British band that emerged from London&#226;&#128;&#153;s psychedelic scene in 1967. Online only, Mitchell will be in conversation with Hari Kunzru, the author of <em>White Tears</em>.</p>

<p>This video gallery celebrates the achievement of 2019/20 Seattle Youth Poet Laureate, Wei-Wei Lee, and the public release of her first poetry collection, <em>In the Footsteps of a Thousand Griefs </em>(Poetry NW Editions). The gallery opens with Wei-Wei reading from her debut, followed by conversation between Wei-Wei and her YPL mentors, Aaron Counts and Matt Gano. Following this celebration, we welcome the incoming 2020/21 Seattle Youth Poet Laureate cohort in a series of videos.</p>

<p>This multi-media gallery commemorates the time students spent writing and creating with WITS during the truncated 2019/20 school year. This gallery is a testament to the hard work of students, writers, teachers, and school communities across the Puget Sound area. Now this work can be seen, shared, and celebrated by those we miss, care for, and wish we were closer to right now.</p>

<p><strong>A Message from Ruth Dickey, SAL Executive Director</strong></p>

<p>Dear friends of Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures,</p>

<p>Black lives matter. Black stories matter.&#160;<a href="https://lectures.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures</a>&#160;(SAL) stands in solidarity with Black authors, teaching artists, educators, students, colleagues, board members, volunteers, artists, partners, community members, and audience members. We stand with protestors who are demanding justice. Words matter; they have the power to spark change and to tell the stories we need to hear. But actions&#160;<em>also</em>&#160;matter. So how will we take action?</p>

<p>We&#226;&#128;&#153;re committed to making our spaces and events accessible to all. We want to make positive adjustments so that our patrons&#226;&#128;&#153; experiences are the best they can be. Read on for a brief primer on the accessibility options you can expect and request at SAL events.</p>

<p>Everyone&#226;&#128;&#153;s favorite free summer reading challenge is back early this year for adults and kids! Keep track of your spring and summer reads from now until&#160;September 8, 2020 by writing the title and author in the matching square, and submit your board by mail, in person, or through social media for a chance to win awesome prizes!</p>

<p>We believe that reading, writing, and creative thinking are indispensable to a curious, engaged, democratic society. Our goal is to make these experiences available to as many people as possible, regardless of economic circumstances&#226;&#128;&#148;which is why we created our Community Access Tickets (CAT) program for our digital and in-person events.</p>
