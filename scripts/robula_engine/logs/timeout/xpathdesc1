<p>The female figure and its place in art history, religion, fantasy and fairy tales is the primary focus of Rachel Feinstein&#226;&#128;&#153;s hybrids of painting and three-dimensional form. The feminist undercurrent in her work is given a flamboyant spin with style cues taken from Baroque art, kitsch, and other styles that lean in on theatricality or sentimentality.</p>
            
<p>On view are 75 works from MoMA&#226;&#128;&#153;s collection chosen by the painter Amy Sillman to elucidate the role of shape in the creation of art. Jasper Johns, Kiki Smith and Marcel Duchamp are among the names included in this selection, which is presented in a kind of modified salon-style installation.</p>
            
<p>The figurative painter&#226;&#128;&#153;s first solo museum exhibition in New York City showcases the indelible sense of presence she imbues to subjects who are often overlooked in life.</p>
            
<p>Encompassing modern day Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, the African region known as the western Sahel lies just south of the Saharan Desert, and it was there that a succession of mighty empires rose and fell between the Second and 19th centuries. Made wealthy and powerful by a network of trade routes that ran through the area, these dominions developed a rich visual culture which is now being given a showcase in this selection of 200 objects that includes sculptures in wood, stone, fired clay, and bronze; objects in gold and cast metal; woven and dyed textiles; and illuminated manuscripts.</p>
            
<p>By the late 1950s Abstract Expressionism had run its course, while its core tenet&#226;&#128;&#148;that painting through gestural brushwork constituted a kind of existential theater with the artist as star&#226;&#128;&#148;had hardened into orthodoxy. Representational styles like Pop Art emerged in reaction, but there remained a group of painters committed to abstraction who looked for a fresh approach. They found it through an emphasis on color achieved by soaking thinned pigments into the canvas instead of slathering it on the surface. Variously called Lyrical Expressionism or Color Field painting, the style was championed by New York art critic Clement Greenberg (whose previous writings on Pollock, De Kooning, et al. were instrumental in boosting AbEx) though its impact was largely confined the early 1960s. This exhibition revisits that period with works by key figures of the time such as and Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski.</p>
