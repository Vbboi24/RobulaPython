<p>MadArt Studio is an artists&#226;&#128;&#153; workspace, gallery, and private event venue located in Seattle&#226;&#128;&#153;s South Lake Union neighborhood, just north of downtown. As a contemporary art space, we host events during and between our large-scale, interactive installations as we are able. Featuring the building&#226;&#128;&#153;s original brick alongside exposed beams and floor-to-ceiling windows, MadArt Studio provides a distinctive yet versatile space for a variety of gatherings, including weddings, corporate meetings, intimate dinners, and cocktail soirees.</p>

<p>Constructed in the 1920s, the studio was once a car dealership and later a DMV where the first driving tests were conducted. Nearly a century later, this historic building has been re-imagined with the help of celebrated Seattle design firm, Graham Baba Architects, this time as a hub for unique events and artistic innovation. Nearly 3800 square feet, a full kitchen, and high ceilings make MadArt Studio the ideal location for a reception of up to 275 guests (175 seated), or a celebratory meal with your closest friends and family. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By choosing to host your event at MadArt Studio, you are in turn supporting artists in creating new, immersive exhibitions&#160;and sharing them with the community.</span></p>

<p>Get in touch with our Studio Manager, stop by to see the space for yourself, and let us help you create a memorable experience for you and your guests.</p>
