<p>As the global pandemic continues to create uncertainty and upheaval, we have made the difficult decision to take an intermission for ArtWeek 2021 as the Center re-evaluates its strategic priorities amid new realities, and as funders and supporters explore how best to support both the people and organizations in our communities that have been most deeply impacted by this crisis.</p>

<p>Since 2013, the launch and growth of ArtWeek has been a rare opportunity to create a platform of affordable and accessible cultural opportunities for All across the creative Commonwealth. Over six years, it has grown from less than 30 events in Greater Boston to a statewide festival with almost 800 events in 170 communities across the state.  With mostly free events, it has opened the doors for tens of thousands of children, families, residents, and visitors to explore their creative side and to discover the invaluable contributions offered by our creative communities.</p>

<p>A special thanks goes out to the Highland Street Foundation, who has shared our commitment of Art for All from the beginning.  The support of the Massachusetts Cultural Council and Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism has been invaluable as our Lead Champions in fostering new collaborations between cultural districts, regional tourism councils, and creative communities of all kinds.  We are also indebted to the extensive contributions of our many media sponsors who made sure that ArtWeek events and partners were always center stage each spring, as well as the countless other financial and in-kind sponsors whose support made ArtWeek a reality.  And of course, ArtWeek simply couldn&#226;&#128;&#153;t have happened without the tireless work and passionate commitment of hundreds of event hosts and community partners each year.  The Boch Center was proud to host ArtWeek@Home this year. </p>

<p>The Boch Center is proud that ArtWeek was able to become a statewide spotlight on how important arts, culture, and creativity truly are to our everyday lives and we are confident that the ArtWeek spirit will continue to thrive no matter what, offering hope, joy, and creative comfort to everyone across the state.  As we reimagine what the creative future holds, we want to thank you and the hundreds of creative communities across the Commonwealth for making ArtWeek always shine so brightly.  Be safe &#226;&#128;&#147; and always keep being creative.</p>

<p>Presented by Highland Street Foundation and produced by the Boch Center, ArtWeek has become an annual award-winning innovative festival featuring hundreds of unique and creative experiences across the state that are hands-on, interactive or offer behind-the-scenes access to artists or the creative process. Launched in 2013 by the Boch Center as part of a mission-driven strategy to strengthen its role in both the community and the creative economy beyond just its downtown historic theaters, ArtWeek&#226;&#128;&#153;s growth has been explosive and the festival has become the Center&#226;&#128;&#153;s signature nonprofit community-wide program.
</p>

<p>In May 2017, the Boch Center announced ArtWeek was expanding statewide and launched a new logo, website address (ArtWeekMA.org) with continued support from founding partner Highland Street Foundation. Statewide champions of ArtWeek include the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Office of Travel &amp; Tourism, and the Mass Cultural Council, who are joined by hundreds of community and media partners representing every region in the Commonwealth. Featuring hundreds of arts and cultural experiences (many free), the event is now cited as one of the area&#226;&#128;&#153;s top special events and the &#226;&#128;&#156;Bay State&#226;&#128;&#153;s most creative festival.&#226;&#128;&#157;   ArtWeek 2020 (May 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; May 10) promises to light even more creative sparks!</p>
