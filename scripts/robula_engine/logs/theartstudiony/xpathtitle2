<div class="content">A few months back, my friends organized a paint and sip party for me at the Art Studio NY. Had a great time. Michelle, the events coordinator, was really great at making sure everyone was comfortable and taken care of. The party was a lot of fun, and I really appreciated the professionalism of the staff and art teacher.</div>

<div class="content">Sophia and Jessie did a phenomenal job leading our customized painting class for our real estate firm, and working with the team at The Art Studio NY was a breeze. Everyone who attended had a great experience, and we look forward to the next time!</div>

<div class="content">This the second team building event we have had with The Art Studio NY at our hedge fund. Our core executive staff consists of 40 people, and most of us don&#226;&#128;&#153;t know how to paint or draw! Rebecca, Michelle and all of the instructors brought out the artist in all of us. They went above and beyond to understand our goals and create an outstanding experience. Their attention to detail in planning our event combined with their step by step art instruction impressed my entire team. Our paintings are hanging in our offices and we are all still talking about hoe memorable this experience was for us.</div>

<div class="content">I hosted my annual company party for my interior design firm here, and it was a huge success! We had SO much fun, we are all still talking about it weeks later! Rebecca was an energetic and inspiring instructor, and Michelle was a pleasure to work with in ironing out all of the details. Everything was perfectly organized and SO customized to exactly what I wanted. We are definitely coming back!</div>

<div class="content">I held our annual corporate event at The Art Studio NY, and I was thoroughly impressed. The customer service was beyond my expectations, and their staff created one of the most unique, inspiring and fun group events I have ever attended.
