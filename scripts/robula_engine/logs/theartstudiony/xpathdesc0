Our core executive staff consists of 40 people, and most of us don&#226;&#128;&#153;t know how to paint or draw! Rebecca, Michelle and all of the instructors brought out the artist in all of us. They went above and beyond to understand our goals and create an outstanding experience. Their attention to detail in planning our event combined with their step by step art instruction impressed my entire team. Our paintings are hanging in our offices and we are all still talking about hoe memorable this experience was for us.",
