<span style="color:#000000;">Berta was born in Detroit to a socially conscious culturally Jewish family. She attended the magnet high school, Cass Tech, where she designed murals for a Detroit shopfront about the Four Freedoms, a Roosevelt initiative to support the World War II effort to assert American values. She won scholarships and awards at the Art Students League in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the University of Iowa, including the prestigious Tiffany Award for printmaking. Her work has been internationally exhibited, and is in major American collections, including the Harvard University Art Museums. Her art developed from the expressiveness of the 1940s and 1950s to the hard edge abstraction of the 1960&#226;&#128;&#153;s. From there, she followed her own path, involving cosmic visions and explorations of space, to paint a series of paintings of Crab Nebulae and Black Holes. This culminated in a musical production accompanied by her paintings, directed by Paul and Rosalie DiCrescenzo, performed widely in the Boston area. These paintings shown here are from that production, The Watchers and the Watched. Abigael MacGibeny, a Boston art historian, is an authority on her work, and will soon publish on Golahny&#226;&#128;&#153;s achievement. The Cambridge Center for Adult Education every year presents awards in her name to outstanding instructors and students. In 2018, a major exhibition of her paintings and prints was held at the Lycoming College Art Gallery, Williamsport, Pennsylvania. For more information, contact: golahny@lycoming.edu</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">I have silk screened through a volunteer program at the Woman&#226;&#128;&#153;s Studio Workshop in Roslindale, New York, and held a job for a while as an ink technician in New Hampshire. I have taken several classes at the Arlington Center For the Arts, combined with every art elective available in high school. This is the sum of any kind of formal training I can attest to. I withdrew from creating artistically for close to 10 years. It has taken a good portion of my life and the support of a few incredible individuals to figure out that this is what speaks to me most, that this is a conduit for re-framing how I view the world and participate in it. There is something inherently unconditional about the experience of creating and sharing art and it is a constant source of motivation for me.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Meia Geddes&#160;is particularly fond of rendering birds, trees, and roses. This may or may not be because she was born as a bird, grew up in the city of trees, and spent some time in the city of roses. In other words, she was born in China, adopted and raised by her mother in California, and spent about a year in South Africa thanks to a Fulbright grant. Meia received her BA from Brown University and MS from Simmons University&#226;&#128;&#153;s School of Library and Information Science, and is now based in Boston. She recycles words and shares the language generated from those words on Instagram @recycledword. She has written two books, <em>The Little Queen</em> and <em>Love Letters to the World</em>, and is working on a third called <em>Little World Forms: Experiments in Sentence-Level Utopias</em>. Her website is <a href="http://www.meiageddes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.meiageddes.com</a> and she is also on Twitter @meiageddes.<br>

<span style="color:#000000;">Alvan Long creates captivating 2D and 3D mixed media art in which found objects are resurrected and assembled discerningly to tell affecting stories and make powerful statements about our culture. He attributes much of the inspiration for this body of work to growing up in Detroit. As a child he absorbed this environment. Laden with pollution, crumbling factories and piles of debris, remembers becoming aware of the beauty that lies in degradation. Every found object, however seemingly mundane, contains a story worthy of being told. With the magic of one with this sensibility, he unites relative objects to tell a larger story. Using polyurethane he cements these objects into magnificent and elaborate assemblages. The subject matter is predominantly urban and most often illustrates an event or person in history. Street signs, advertisements, pop culture icons and beauty queens interspersed among scraps of metal, wood, splashes of paint and stencil. The canvas could be anything from a car bumper to an ornate mirror frame to a cabinet door.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">I am a jack of all trades and an outdoors enthusiast. I enjoy expressing my appreciation of nature and science through my artwork. &#160;My pieces have the energy and forms found in nature. I am currently exploring the applications of fluorescence and LED lighting as well as the high electricity to produce my art. I have labeled my main series High Voltage Pyrography. It is also know as Lichtenberg Figures. I create electrical patterns similar to lightning strikes. Working with lower voltage and longer discharge times allows me to design the patterns. The fractal patterns represents the breakdown of insulating material into carbon. &#160;A water based solution is used to coat the surface of the wood and increase the conductivity to the point where a 2,000 volt transformer will create an arc across the surface.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I am a Savin Hill resident and have had a studio at Out of the Blue Gallery for 22 years. My 3D images are created in various photographic mediums that I hand cut out, especially the windows in the scene of a photograph, and insert a completely different view behind the &#226;&#128;&#156;glass&#226;&#128;&#157; of a window. I enjoy exploring the juxtaposition of 3-dimensional views within a two-dimensional medium. In exploring the 3D experience I have created a series I call &#226;&#128;&#156;A Whole from A Half.&#226;&#128;&#157; I hope you do enjoy my views of the world that we live in. Thank you!</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Painting for me is an outlet much like writing poetry. When I am alone and trying to process my feelings or my traumatic past, the colors and textures that I am creating help me to heal with each stroke. I enjoy making a colorful palate with thickened paint and beach sand. Of course I love listening to music that coincides with my different moods. There is nothing as free as making art. It is my salvation. During the day, I usually sketch in my drawing pad anything that comes to mind&#226;&#128;&#147;&#226;&#128;&#147;be it a leaf, a rose, an angel floating in the sky, or just an abstract of unrestrained emotions.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Jymi Cliche has battled PTSD and many other demons in his life. He&#226;&#128;&#153;s felt the weight of the world for as long as he remembers but has been working hard to make progress and stay positive. His art is his expression of what&#226;&#128;&#153;s going on inside. Nothing is really planned. He picks the colors that are speaking to him and throws them onto the canvas however his gut/soul wants it done. Very little thinking is involved. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s done in a mostly mindful state. The goal in his process is expressing his feelings in a way he can look at after and analyze like a dream. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s his subconsciousness speaking for a part of him that he has no words for.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Paul Shea was an oil painter who resided in Cambridge, MA. He unfortunately passed away about 10 years ago, but he leaves a legacy of made-in-person nudes with beautiful models. He was a prolific figure painter and scenery artist of ocean boats and marshes throughout the Boston area. He also loved painting architecture like local churches and other landmarks. We at Out of the Blue Too miss him as a former long-term, resident artist.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Rachel currently graduates with a Bachelors in Fine Arts. She has been an artistic organizer to Firefly Arts Committee as well as Section 17 for several years.

<span style="color:#000000;">I love pen and ink. I started using a crow quill pen originally, then moved into etching and lithography. Currently I use micron pens, Pilot G2 pens .038, .05, and pencils. I have always leaned towards pen and pencils to do my drawings. I have tried other mediums, but always revert back to pens. I have been drawing all my life. Sometimes 24/7 for months on end. Some of my drawings can take months to complete. Most of my art is about the universe and God. My favorite subjects are astronomy, spiritual evolution, and God.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Sue Carlin lives and paints in Stow, Massachusetts. Her colorful florals swirling landscapes and vibrant portraits are reminiscent of the works of Van Gogh and Matisse. Sue is a founding member of out of the Blue Gallery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has had many solo and group shows in the Boston area.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">My subject matter is people. Whether friends, family, total strangers, gypsies, or icons, I strive to capture &#226;&#128;&#152;human moments in time&#226;&#128;&#153;&#226;&#128;&#147;eschewing traditional poses in favor of stealth-photography and &#226;&#128;&#152;found&#226;&#128;&#153; images from social media as source material. I paint in oils using palette knives rather than brushes, so I am better able to focus on color, shape, motion, texture, and mood rather than purely representative detail. The thick spring of metal knives frees me from brush strokes and &#226;&#128;&#152;pushing paint&#226;&#128;&#153;&#226;&#128;&#147;and focusing on the more meaningful &#226;&#128;&#156;image-within-the-image&#226;&#128;&#157; that I have chosen to portray. I recently began realizing a lifelong dream of working in stone, carving in alabaster and soapstone using a combination of traditional hammer, chisel and files plus hand-held rotary and power tools. Even in stone, my siren song is always the human form and its expression of the human condition.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I&#226;&#128;&#153;ve been painting since 2016. All my art is acrylic on canvas and oil based Sharpie paint markers. Most are specific visions I have and others are free style. If you look through my mediums, you will see my spiritual process.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Art is magic. The paintings I construct can be any topic ranging from landscape, portrait or abstract. My style is ever changing and evolving. I love using oil for a medium. Everything that comes to me does so from something from the past that had caught my eye or an immediate reaction to something that just happened. I like to display and share the end result because once I paint them, the feelings that I had at the time are transferred into the art itself and conveys that experience. My happiness stems from others experiencing something new when seeing my art. I want it to inspire them and invoke emotion. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s almost a way for me to transfer a bit of myself to those around me.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I did not find visual art. Visual art found me. Sure, I drew some interesting abstracts in notebooks over the years, but that was my secret. I did not expect to be painting with acrylics on a regular basis until relatively recently. Showing my art to anyone other than my cat was never a consideration. What does my art fingerprint look like? Well, it is filled with textures; few of my works are completely flat. The flat ones are generally created with acrylic ink and marker rather than paint. Frequent subjects matters include cats, Day of the Dead, cosmic entities, voluptuous posteriors, and abstract oddities not easily described. I view each painting as a poem written in a language of colors and images. I hope you enjoy my art.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Our eyes or a sharp lens see in detail. An eyelash, the lines in a lip or smile. Our hearts and souls see in somewhat fuzzy and blurred root shapes influenced by feelings that become what we see. It does turn into a kind of feedback loop between the eye, emotion, and image. In my black and white photos I try to capture that moment and the primal shapes of what becomes what we see. In the three &#226;&#128;&#156;B/W&#226;&#128;&#157; photos here there has been some experimenting with the chemicals used to develop the final print. And sometimes it is just fun to have a nice sharp photograph of a day on the beach with your dog!</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">My art is based on my surroundings: Dumb people, animals, life, love, death, and words and phrases that peak my interest. I enjoy color and making a mess. I consider most of my work self portraits and often deal with my self in a comical way. My work is usually an inside joke or something silly that makes me laugh. I like beer and music and I have six cats and a beautiful and talented wife.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If one is to see past the normal human&#226;&#128;&#153;s semi-self-awareess, knowing what is right and wrong for oneself to do is true self-awareness. What I mean by true self-awareness is that one understands that all of one&#226;&#128;&#153;s beliefs are just that &#226;&#128;&#147; beliefs; based off personal experience. The understanding of metaphysics being a world of splotchy gray constructs fading in and out of each-other with line drawn from every point of view, dividing them into systems of beliefs to base your life off of to obtain food, shelter, and maintain happiness. If one is capable of seeing the world as the blind leading the blind, following an echo down the &#226;&#128;&#156;wrong&#226;&#128;&#157; turn in the cavern, blinding us all&#226;&#128;&#166; If you don&#226;&#128;&#153;t already see life is this way, this isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t for you. If you do, here&#226;&#128;&#153;s some helpful advice&#226;&#128;&#166; Here is how to create your own meaning and combat lack of objective meaning. Look back before you thought it all out: what did you do for yourself and others? Let that become your meaning. Don&#226;&#128;&#153;t let your thoughts of lacking objective meaning consume you. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s hard, and I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t have a step-by-step way of fighting it, other than life is meaningless, enjoy it, do what you believe even if it&#226;&#128;&#153;s just a belief. Love, the abstraction is not what I am talking about. I&#226;&#128;&#153;m talking about how you feel when you honestly tell someone you love them. Maybe your heart does flips, maybe you feel like you are basking.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">This piece varies in topics &#226;&#128;&#147; from the drug war to the Martin Luther King assassination, CIA and FBI cover-ups, the deception and worship of television, and South American revolutionaries. Puppets are posing as politicians on the chains of fat business pigs. An upside-down flag represents distress and a scull burns through the cloth with money in its eyes. It eats stars from the flag that represent states being engulfed by government waste. A cowboy kicks out an Indian while he drags in a black slave. Uncle Sam, depicted as a fat pig, holds a noose while the justice system is shown as racist and brutal. The clown the pops out of Uncle Sam&#226;&#128;&#153;s hat and missiles shoot out of his head to show this country&#226;&#128;&#153;s thinking &#226;&#128;&#147; not with brains but with weapons.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Markus Nechay is a beloved long term artist of the Gallery. He evokes biology and history in all of his pieces. Famous around Boston for his own art gallery on Franklin St and art shows around all local libraries, Markus is most incredible for being in the Boston papers as someone who truly &#226;&#128;&#156;died&#226;&#128;&#157; and came back after his heart ceased. Moved by returning to this earth, Markus is fascinated with the human body and its birth, death, and rebirth!</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Kristin Ringman is a deaf artist, author, and wanderer. Her paternal family came from Sweden and Finland before they immigrated to America, so the title of her art business draws upon these origins as well as her studies in Norse shamanism and the fox as one of her animal familiars. Acrylic paint is her current preferred medium, and she loves to paint on wood panels and wood rounds. Kristin uses 16 gauge copper wire for hanging most of her paintings and leather cording for the smallest ones. Kristin is also the author of two Lambda Literary finalist books: I Stole You: Stories from the Fae (Hand Typed Press, 2017), Makara: A Novel (Hand Typed Press 2012). She writes lyrical, comical literary fiction novels that play along the boundaries of magical realism, fantasy, horror and which always feature deaf/disabled/LBGTQ/marginalized main characters.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Following the death of her father, Kristina produced these captivating, spacey, tantric, chakra-evoking heat acrylic &amp; oil based works.

<span style="color:#000000;">I&#226;&#128;&#153;m originally from Baltimore and have been living in Boston for the past five years. My format of choice is 35 mm and 120 mm film with a focus on street photography and natural scenes. When I go out to take photos, I tend to select a location and just photograph whatever is going on in that moment. I have been taking photos for as long as I can remember, but only recently have begun to display my work in public settings. </span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Berta was born in Detroit to a socially conscious culturally Jewish family. She attended the magnet high school, Cass Tech, where she designed murals for a Detroit shopfront about the Four Freedoms, a Roosevelt initiative to support the World War II effort to assert American values. She won scholarships and awards at the Art Students League in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the University of Iowa, including the prestigious Tiffany Award for printmaking. Her work has been internationally exhibited, and is in major American collections, including the Harvard University Art Museums. Her art developed from the expressiveness of the 1940s and 1950s to the hard edge abstraction of the 1960&#226;&#128;&#153;s. From there, she followed her own path, involving cosmic visions and explorations of space, to paint a series of paintings of Crab Nebulae and Black Holes. This culminated in a musical production accompanied by her paintings, directed by Paul and Rosalie DiCrescenzo, performed widely in the Boston area. These paintings shown here are from that production, The Watchers and the Watched. Abigael MacGibeny, a Boston art historian, is an authority on her work, and will soon publish on Golahny&#226;&#128;&#153;s achievement. The Cambridge Center for Adult Education every year presents awards in her name to outstanding instructors and students. In 2018, a major exhibition of her paintings and prints was held at the Lycoming College Art Gallery, Williamsport, Pennsylvania. For more information, contact: golahny@lycoming.edu</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">I have silk screened through a volunteer program at the Woman&#226;&#128;&#153;s Studio Workshop in Roslindale, New York, and held a job for a while as an ink technician in New Hampshire. I have taken several classes at the Arlington Center For the Arts, combined with every art elective available in high school. This is the sum of any kind of formal training I can attest to. I withdrew from creating artistically for close to 10 years. It has taken a good portion of my life and the support of a few incredible individuals to figure out that this is what speaks to me most, that this is a conduit for re-framing how I view the world and participate in it. There is something inherently unconditional about the experience of creating and sharing art and it is a constant source of motivation for me.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Meia Geddes&#160;is particularly fond of rendering birds, trees, and roses. This may or may not be because she was born as a bird, grew up in the city of trees, and spent some time in the city of roses. In other words, she was born in China, adopted and raised by her mother in California, and spent about a year in South Africa thanks to a Fulbright grant. Meia received her BA from Brown University and MS from Simmons University&#226;&#128;&#153;s School of Library and Information Science, and is now based in Boston. She recycles words and shares the language generated from those words on Instagram @recycledword. She has written two books, <em>The Little Queen</em> and <em>Love Letters to the World</em>, and is working on a third called <em>Little World Forms: Experiments in Sentence-Level Utopias</em>. Her website is <a href="http://www.meiageddes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.meiageddes.com</a> and she is also on Twitter @meiageddes.<br>

<span style="color:#000000;">Alvan Long creates captivating 2D and 3D mixed media art in which found objects are resurrected and assembled discerningly to tell affecting stories and make powerful statements about our culture. He attributes much of the inspiration for this body of work to growing up in Detroit. As a child he absorbed this environment. Laden with pollution, crumbling factories and piles of debris, remembers becoming aware of the beauty that lies in degradation. Every found object, however seemingly mundane, contains a story worthy of being told. With the magic of one with this sensibility, he unites relative objects to tell a larger story. Using polyurethane he cements these objects into magnificent and elaborate assemblages. The subject matter is predominantly urban and most often illustrates an event or person in history. Street signs, advertisements, pop culture icons and beauty queens interspersed among scraps of metal, wood, splashes of paint and stencil. The canvas could be anything from a car bumper to an ornate mirror frame to a cabinet door.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">I am a jack of all trades and an outdoors enthusiast. I enjoy expressing my appreciation of nature and science through my artwork. &#160;My pieces have the energy and forms found in nature. I am currently exploring the applications of fluorescence and LED lighting as well as the high electricity to produce my art. I have labeled my main series High Voltage Pyrography. It is also know as Lichtenberg Figures. I create electrical patterns similar to lightning strikes. Working with lower voltage and longer discharge times allows me to design the patterns. The fractal patterns represents the breakdown of insulating material into carbon. &#160;A water based solution is used to coat the surface of the wood and increase the conductivity to the point where a 2,000 volt transformer will create an arc across the surface.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I am a Savin Hill resident and have had a studio at Out of the Blue Gallery for 22 years. My 3D images are created in various photographic mediums that I hand cut out, especially the windows in the scene of a photograph, and insert a completely different view behind the &#226;&#128;&#156;glass&#226;&#128;&#157; of a window. I enjoy exploring the juxtaposition of 3-dimensional views within a two-dimensional medium. In exploring the 3D experience I have created a series I call &#226;&#128;&#156;A Whole from A Half.&#226;&#128;&#157; I hope you do enjoy my views of the world that we live in. Thank you!</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Painting for me is an outlet much like writing poetry. When I am alone and trying to process my feelings or my traumatic past, the colors and textures that I am creating help me to heal with each stroke. I enjoy making a colorful palate with thickened paint and beach sand. Of course I love listening to music that coincides with my different moods. There is nothing as free as making art. It is my salvation. During the day, I usually sketch in my drawing pad anything that comes to mind&#226;&#128;&#147;&#226;&#128;&#147;be it a leaf, a rose, an angel floating in the sky, or just an abstract of unrestrained emotions.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Jymi Cliche has battled PTSD and many other demons in his life. He&#226;&#128;&#153;s felt the weight of the world for as long as he remembers but has been working hard to make progress and stay positive. His art is his expression of what&#226;&#128;&#153;s going on inside. Nothing is really planned. He picks the colors that are speaking to him and throws them onto the canvas however his gut/soul wants it done. Very little thinking is involved. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s done in a mostly mindful state. The goal in his process is expressing his feelings in a way he can look at after and analyze like a dream. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s his subconsciousness speaking for a part of him that he has no words for.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Paul Shea was an oil painter who resided in Cambridge, MA. He unfortunately passed away about 10 years ago, but he leaves a legacy of made-in-person nudes with beautiful models. He was a prolific figure painter and scenery artist of ocean boats and marshes throughout the Boston area. He also loved painting architecture like local churches and other landmarks. We at Out of the Blue Too miss him as a former long-term, resident artist.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Rachel currently graduates with a Bachelors in Fine Arts. She has been an artistic organizer to Firefly Arts Committee as well as Section 17 for several years.

<span style="color:#000000;">I love pen and ink. I started using a crow quill pen originally, then moved into etching and lithography. Currently I use micron pens, Pilot G2 pens .038, .05, and pencils. I have always leaned towards pen and pencils to do my drawings. I have tried other mediums, but always revert back to pens. I have been drawing all my life. Sometimes 24/7 for months on end. Some of my drawings can take months to complete. Most of my art is about the universe and God. My favorite subjects are astronomy, spiritual evolution, and God.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Sue Carlin lives and paints in Stow, Massachusetts. Her colorful florals swirling landscapes and vibrant portraits are reminiscent of the works of Van Gogh and Matisse. Sue is a founding member of out of the Blue Gallery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has had many solo and group shows in the Boston area.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">My subject matter is people. Whether friends, family, total strangers, gypsies, or icons, I strive to capture &#226;&#128;&#152;human moments in time&#226;&#128;&#153;&#226;&#128;&#147;eschewing traditional poses in favor of stealth-photography and &#226;&#128;&#152;found&#226;&#128;&#153; images from social media as source material. I paint in oils using palette knives rather than brushes, so I am better able to focus on color, shape, motion, texture, and mood rather than purely representative detail. The thick spring of metal knives frees me from brush strokes and &#226;&#128;&#152;pushing paint&#226;&#128;&#153;&#226;&#128;&#147;and focusing on the more meaningful &#226;&#128;&#156;image-within-the-image&#226;&#128;&#157; that I have chosen to portray. I recently began realizing a lifelong dream of working in stone, carving in alabaster and soapstone using a combination of traditional hammer, chisel and files plus hand-held rotary and power tools. Even in stone, my siren song is always the human form and its expression of the human condition.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I&#226;&#128;&#153;ve been painting since 2016. All my art is acrylic on canvas and oil based Sharpie paint markers. Most are specific visions I have and others are free style. If you look through my mediums, you will see my spiritual process.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Art is magic. The paintings I construct can be any topic ranging from landscape, portrait or abstract. My style is ever changing and evolving. I love using oil for a medium. Everything that comes to me does so from something from the past that had caught my eye or an immediate reaction to something that just happened. I like to display and share the end result because once I paint them, the feelings that I had at the time are transferred into the art itself and conveys that experience. My happiness stems from others experiencing something new when seeing my art. I want it to inspire them and invoke emotion. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s almost a way for me to transfer a bit of myself to those around me.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">I did not find visual art. Visual art found me. Sure, I drew some interesting abstracts in notebooks over the years, but that was my secret. I did not expect to be painting with acrylics on a regular basis until relatively recently. Showing my art to anyone other than my cat was never a consideration. What does my art fingerprint look like? Well, it is filled with textures; few of my works are completely flat. The flat ones are generally created with acrylic ink and marker rather than paint. Frequent subjects matters include cats, Day of the Dead, cosmic entities, voluptuous posteriors, and abstract oddities not easily described. I view each painting as a poem written in a language of colors and images. I hope you enjoy my art.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Our eyes or a sharp lens see in detail. An eyelash, the lines in a lip or smile. Our hearts and souls see in somewhat fuzzy and blurred root shapes influenced by feelings that become what we see. It does turn into a kind of feedback loop between the eye, emotion, and image. In my black and white photos I try to capture that moment and the primal shapes of what becomes what we see. In the three &#226;&#128;&#156;B/W&#226;&#128;&#157; photos here there has been some experimenting with the chemicals used to develop the final print. And sometimes it is just fun to have a nice sharp photograph of a day on the beach with your dog!</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">My art is based on my surroundings: Dumb people, animals, life, love, death, and words and phrases that peak my interest. I enjoy color and making a mess. I consider most of my work self portraits and often deal with my self in a comical way. My work is usually an inside joke or something silly that makes me laugh. I like beer and music and I have six cats and a beautiful and talented wife.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">If one is to see past the normal human&#226;&#128;&#153;s semi-self-awareess, knowing what is right and wrong for oneself to do is true self-awareness. What I mean by true self-awareness is that one understands that all of one&#226;&#128;&#153;s beliefs are just that &#226;&#128;&#147; beliefs; based off personal experience. The understanding of metaphysics being a world of splotchy gray constructs fading in and out of each-other with line drawn from every point of view, dividing them into systems of beliefs to base your life off of to obtain food, shelter, and maintain happiness. If one is capable of seeing the world as the blind leading the blind, following an echo down the &#226;&#128;&#156;wrong&#226;&#128;&#157; turn in the cavern, blinding us all&#226;&#128;&#166; If you don&#226;&#128;&#153;t already see life is this way, this isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t for you. If you do, here&#226;&#128;&#153;s some helpful advice&#226;&#128;&#166; Here is how to create your own meaning and combat lack of objective meaning. Look back before you thought it all out: what did you do for yourself and others? Let that become your meaning. Don&#226;&#128;&#153;t let your thoughts of lacking objective meaning consume you. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s hard, and I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t have a step-by-step way of fighting it, other than life is meaningless, enjoy it, do what you believe even if it&#226;&#128;&#153;s just a belief. Love, the abstraction is not what I am talking about. I&#226;&#128;&#153;m talking about how you feel when you honestly tell someone you love them. Maybe your heart does flips, maybe you feel like you are basking.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">This piece varies in topics &#226;&#128;&#147; from the drug war to the Martin Luther King assassination, CIA and FBI cover-ups, the deception and worship of television, and South American revolutionaries. Puppets are posing as politicians on the chains of fat business pigs. An upside-down flag represents distress and a scull burns through the cloth with money in its eyes. It eats stars from the flag that represent states being engulfed by government waste. A cowboy kicks out an Indian while he drags in a black slave. Uncle Sam, depicted as a fat pig, holds a noose while the justice system is shown as racist and brutal. The clown the pops out of Uncle Sam&#226;&#128;&#153;s hat and missiles shoot out of his head to show this country&#226;&#128;&#153;s thinking &#226;&#128;&#147; not with brains but with weapons.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Markus Nechay is a beloved long term artist of the Gallery. He evokes biology and history in all of his pieces. Famous around Boston for his own art gallery on Franklin St and art shows around all local libraries, Markus is most incredible for being in the Boston papers as someone who truly &#226;&#128;&#156;died&#226;&#128;&#157; and came back after his heart ceased. Moved by returning to this earth, Markus is fascinated with the human body and its birth, death, and rebirth!</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Kristin Ringman is a deaf artist, author, and wanderer. Her paternal family came from Sweden and Finland before they immigrated to America, so the title of her art business draws upon these origins as well as her studies in Norse shamanism and the fox as one of her animal familiars. Acrylic paint is her current preferred medium, and she loves to paint on wood panels and wood rounds. Kristin uses 16 gauge copper wire for hanging most of her paintings and leather cording for the smallest ones. Kristin is also the author of two Lambda Literary finalist books: I Stole You: Stories from the Fae (Hand Typed Press, 2017), Makara: A Novel (Hand Typed Press 2012). She writes lyrical, comical literary fiction novels that play along the boundaries of magical realism, fantasy, horror and which always feature deaf/disabled/LBGTQ/marginalized main characters.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Following the death of her father, Kristina produced these captivating, spacey, tantric, chakra-evoking heat acrylic &amp; oil based works.

<span style="color:#000000;">I&#226;&#128;&#153;m originally from Baltimore and have been living in Boston for the past five years. My format of choice is 35 mm and 120 mm film with a focus on street photography and natural scenes. When I go out to take photos, I tend to select a location and just photograph whatever is going on in that moment. I have been taking photos for as long as I can remember, but only recently have begun to display my work in public settings. </span>
